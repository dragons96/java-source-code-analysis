<td align="left">Attempts to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel’s file.  <p> This method does not block.  An invocation always returns immediately, either having acquired a lock on the requested region or having failed to do so.  If it fails to acquire a lock because an overlapping lock is held by another program then it returns <tt>null</tt>.  If it fails to acquire a lock for any other reason then an appropriate exception is thrown.  <p> The region specified by the <tt>position</tt> and <tt>size</tt> parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual underlying file.  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock. If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the expected maximum size of the file, should be locked.  The zero-argument ‘#tryLock()’ method simply locks a region of size ‘Long#MAX_VALUE’.  <p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for an exclusive lock.  Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object’s ‘FileLock#isShared() isShared’ method.  <p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine. They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple threads within the same virtual machine.  </p></td>
