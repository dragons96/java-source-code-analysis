The era ‘CE’ is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value. The era ‘BCE’ is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards. <p> For example, subtracting a year each time yield the following:<br> - year-proleptic 2  &#x3D; ‘CE’ year-of-era 2<br> - year-proleptic 1  &#x3D; ‘CE’ year-of-era 1<br> - year-proleptic 0  &#x3D; ‘BCE’ year-of-era 1<br> - year-proleptic -1 &#x3D; ‘BCE’ year-of-era 2<br> <p> Note that the ISO-8601 standard does not actually define eras.

<td align="center"><strong>INSTANT_SECONDS(“InstantSeconds”, SECONDS, FOREVER, ValueRange.of(Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE))</strong></td>
<td align="left">The instant epoch-seconds. <p> This represents the concept of the sequential count of seconds where 1970-01-01T00:00Z (ISO) is zero. This field may be used with {@link #NANO_OF_SECOND} to represent the fraction of the second. <p> An {@link Instant} represents an instantaneous point on the time-line. On their own, an instant has insufficient information to allow a local date-time to be obtained. Only when paired with an offset or time-zone can the local date or time be calculated. <p> This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems. This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.</td>

<td align="center"><strong>OFFSET_SECONDS(“OffsetSeconds”, SECONDS, FOREVER, ValueRange.of(-18 * 3600, 18 * 3600))</strong></td>
<td align="left">The offset from UTC&#x2F;Greenwich. <p> This represents the concept of the offset in seconds of local time from UTC&#x2F;Greenwich. <p> A {@link ZoneOffset} represents the period of time that local time differs from UTC&#x2F;Greenwich. This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes. It is equivalent to the {@link ZoneOffset#getTotalSeconds() total amount} of the offset in seconds. For example, during the winter Paris has an offset of {@code +01:00}, which is 3600 seconds. <p> This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems. This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.</td>
