However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables. </ul> <p> As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class ‘Object’ does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the Java&amp;trade; programming language.)</td>

<td align="left">Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning of “copy” may depend on the class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object ‘x’, the expression: <blockquote> <pre> x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote> will be true, and that the expression: <blockquote> <pre> x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote> will be ‘true’, but these are not absolute requirements. While it is typically the case that: <blockquote> <pre> x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote> will be ‘true’, this is not an absolute requirement. <p> By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling ‘super.clone’.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except ‘Object’) obey this convention, it will be the case that ‘x.clone().getClass() &#x3D;&#x3D; x.getClass()’. <p> By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by ‘super.clone’ before returning it.  Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal “deep structure” of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by ‘super.clone’ need to be modified. <p> The method ‘clone’ for class ‘Object’ performs a specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does not implement the interface ‘Cloneable’, then a ‘CloneNotSupportedException’ is thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface ‘Cloneable’ and that the return type of the ‘clone’ method of an array type ‘T[]’ is ‘T[]’ where T is any reference or primitive type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method performs a “shallow copy” of this object, not a “deep copy” operation. <p> The class ‘Object’ does not itself implement the interface ‘Cloneable’, so calling the ‘clone’ method on an object whose class is ‘Object’ will result in throwing an exception at run time.</td>

Thread <var>T</var> becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens: <ul> <li>Some other thread invokes the ‘notify’ method for this object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened. <li>Some other thread invokes the ‘notifyAll’ method for this object. <li>Some other thread ‘Thread#interrupt() interrupts’ thread <var>T</var>. <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If ‘timeout’ is zero, however, then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified. </ul> The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object; once it has gained control of the object, all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the ‘wait’ method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the invocation of the ‘wait’ method. Thus, on return from the ‘wait’ method, the synchronization state of the object and of thread ‘T’ is exactly as it was when the ‘wait’ method was invoked. <p> A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words, waits should always occur in loops, like this one: <pre> synchronized (obj) { while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;) obj.wait(timeout); ... } </pre> (For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea’s “Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)” (Addison-Wesley, 2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch’s “Effective Java Programming Language Guide” (Addison-Wesley, 2001).  <p>If the current thread is ‘java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupted’ by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an ‘InterruptedException’ is thrown.  This exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above.  <p> Note that the ‘wait’ method, as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits. <p> This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object’s monitor.

<td align="left">Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the ‘finalize’ method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup. <p> The general contract of ‘finalize’ is that it is invoked if and when the Java&amp;trade; virtual machine has determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be finalized. The ‘finalize’ method may take any action, including making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose of ‘finalize’, however, is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method for an object that represents an input&#x2F;output connection might perform explicit I&#x2F;O transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently discarded. <p> The ‘finalize’ method of class ‘Object’ performs no special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of ‘Object’ may override this definition. <p> The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the ‘finalize’ method for any given object. It is guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method, the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates. <p> After the ‘finalize’ method has been invoked for an object, no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized, at which point the object may be discarded. <p> The ‘finalize’ method is never invoked more than once by a Java virtual machine for any given object. <p> Any exception thrown by the ‘finalize’ method causes the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise ignored.</td>
